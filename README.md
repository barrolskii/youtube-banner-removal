# Youtube Banner Removal
A chromium based browser extension that removes the intrusive YouTube banner pop up and advert video on the home page.

## Purpose
This extension was made for primarily removing the banner that shows at the top of your YouTube home page whenever
YouTube decides to spotlight content creators of a specific community. I have no problem with YouTube doing this,
I actually think this is a good thing but what I don't like is how intrusive the banner itself is. The banner will
take up a large portion of the home page when it loads in leaving very little space for video suggestions. This isn't
a big deal seeing as you can close the banner but this achieves in effect nothing. Upon reloading the home page or
navigating your way back to it the banner will reappear. Having a combination of a large and intrusive pop up on
your home page showing regardless if the content is relevant to you or not, and no way of setting preferences to say
don't show me this banner, this extension was made to get rid of the intrusive pop up.

This extension also removes the video advert that takes up the first slot of your recommended videos. As if having a
banner take up most of the screen isn't bad enough you also have to have one of your video slots taken up by an advert.
I know I could've used an already existing blocker from the extension store but I wanted an excuse to make a browser
extension and this seemed like the perfect excuse to make one.
